# Walmart-Retail-Analysis

•	Used Tableau to visualize data of Walmart Retail on a map view interactive dashboard, demonstrating location and average profit per location as well as quarterly profit by regions 
•	Applied aggregated functions as well as LOD expressions within calculated fields and filters to visualize relationships amongst different dimensions and measures, answering questions like whether there’s a correlation between the size of orders and the items’ discount or whether an order’s priority has a real impact on its speed of delivery
